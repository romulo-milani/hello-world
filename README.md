# hello-world
project hello-world to learn the basics of Github.
Hello, my name is RÃ´mulo, today I'm learning the basics of Github. I'm an aspiring developer and interested in web development, specifically front-end development.
I started coding in C and C++ at college but since then I learned a bit of JavaScript and loved it! Now I'm beginning my studies in HTML and CSS.
